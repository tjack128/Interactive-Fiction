After quickly unlocking their phones, they used their phones’ flashlights as a light source. They then proceeded to look for Roman in the bathroom. As they walked towards the bathroom, they noticed a shadowy figure run from the bathroom to another room. The group was puzzled by the sight and were confused on whether to go to the bathroom to check to see if Roman was there or check in the other room to see who or what the shadowy figure is. |
After going to the bathroom, the group noticed that the bathroom was in a mess. Blood marks were left everywhere, and all the items were scattered and thrown all over the place. Then, they decided to move the bathroom curtain and see what was left. To their shock, it looked completely fine like no one had even touched the area at all. On the soap bar, a note was left. It said, “Do not follow me or else”. While they were initially afraid of the idea of that ominous figure doing harm to others, the group decided to move forward for not only Roman’s sake but theirs as well. |
Upon entering the other room, they saw a lot of claw marks left by the ominous figure. After a thorough inspection, the group concluded that this figure was not human. The only decision that had now was to just inspect the surrounding in the living room and call Roman. |
After many attempted calls, Roman’s phone always went to voicemail. |
The damage has been done and it would take a lot of time to repair these item(s). Nevertheless, it is time to move forward. |
