Welcome to the Interactive Fiction game that Bryce and I developed. It tells the story of a group of friends learning to deal with hardship, tradegy, and loss. But, through these challenges they learn the importance of overcoming one's struggles to see the end. Throughout this journey, the characters will be presented with multiple routes that if selected could drastically alter the story and lead to different endings. Your job as the player is to ensure that the path the characters take is the path that you are satisfied with.
